/**
 * One-shot migration: clear skipAutoPermissionPrompt for users who accepted
 * the old 2-option AutoModeOptInDialog but don't have auto as their default.
 * Re-surfaces the dialog so they see the new "make it my default mode" option.
 * Guard lives in GlobalConfig (~/.claude.json), not settings.json, so it
 * survives settings resets and doesn't re-arm itself.
 *
 * Only runs when tengu_auto_mode_config.enabled === 'enabled'. For 'opt-in'
 * users, clearing skipAutoPermissionPrompt would remove auto from the carousel
 * (permissionSetup.ts:988) — the dialog would become unreachable and the
 * migration would defeat itself. In practice the ~40 target ants are all
 * 'enabled' (they reached the old dialog via bare Shift+Tab, which requires
 * 'enabled'), but the guard makes it safe regardless.
