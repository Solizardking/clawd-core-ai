/**
 * Clear all session-related caches.
 * Call this when resuming a session to ensure fresh file/skill discovery.
 * This is a subset of what clearConversation does - it only clears caches
 * without affecting messages, session ID, or triggering hooks.
 *
 * @param preservedAgentIds - Agent IDs whose per-agent state should survive
 *   the clear (e.g., background tasks preserved across /clear). When non-empty,
 *   agentId-keyed state (invoked skills) is selectively cleared and requestId-keyed
 *   state (pending permission callbacks, dump state, cache-break tracking) is left
 *   intact since it cannot be safely scoped to the main session.
