/**
 * Format an ISO timestamp for the brief/chat message label line.
 *
 * Display scales with age (like a messaging app):
 *   - same day:      "1:30 PM" or "13:30" (locale-dependent)
 *   - within 6 days: "Sunday, 4:15 PM" (locale-dependent)
 *   - older:         "Sunday, Feb 20, 4:30 PM" (locale-dependent)
 *
 * Respects POSIX locale env vars (LC_ALL > LC_TIME > LANG) for time format
 * (12h/24h), weekday names, month names, and overall structure.
 * Bun/V8's `toLocaleString(undefined)` ignores these on macOS, so we
 * convert them to BCP 47 tags ourselves.
 *
 * `now` is injectable for tests.
