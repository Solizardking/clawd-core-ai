/**
 * Clawd with click-triggered animations (crouch-jump with arms up, or
 * look-around). Container height is fixed at CLAWD_HEIGHT — same footprint
 * as a bare `<Clawd />` — so the surrounding layout never shifts. During a
 * crouch only the feet row clips (see comment above). Click only fires when
 * mouse tracking is enabled (i.e. inside `<AlternateScreen>` / fullscreen);
 * elsewhere this renders and behaves identically to plain `<Clawd />`.
