/**
 * Keep the commands list fresh across two triggers:
 *
 * 1. Skill file changes (watcher) — full cache clear + disk re-scan, since
 *    skill content changed on disk.
 * 2. GrowthBook init/refresh — memo-only clear, since only `isEnabled()`
 *    predicates may have changed. Handles commands like /btw whose gate
 *    reads a flag that isn't in the disk cache yet on first session after
 *    a flag rename: getCommands() runs before GB init (main.tsx:2855 vs
 *    showSetupScreens at :3106), so the memoized list is baked with the
 *    default. Once init populates remoteEvalFeatureValues, re-filter.
